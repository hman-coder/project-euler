# Project Euler
My implementation of all project euler solution. For more information please visit [project euler home page](https://projecteuler.net/).

### Structure
Every 10 problems are packed into a single package. Every problem is contained within a package as well, and has its own classes and README file. There is also a class file for every 10 problems. These classes call the algorithm for a problem using the input given in the problem at the website, and prints out results + running time.
