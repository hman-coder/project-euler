# Problem 6

## Definition
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

**1**<sup>2</sup> + **2**<sup>2</sup> + ... + **10**<sup>2</sup> = **385**

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

**(1+2+3+...+10)**<sup>2</sup> **= 55**<sup>2</sup> **=3025**

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is .

**3025-385=2640**

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
