# Problem 2

## Definition
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2,
the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the
even-valued terms

## Solution
Hold the last two values in some variables x, y. In each loop, calculate the new term and add it if it's even, then move y's value to x, and set y's value to be the new term.
